## Introduction to problem / Question
When studying atmospheric-related phenomena, one may use observations (like data from weather stations) or simulated datasets based on numerical models. Also, one may want to investigate and explore a phenomenon or behavior which has happened already in the past, or may be interested in prediction of an event or behavior. As a result, different datasets should be incorporated given the nature of the study.
Essentially, there are three types of models: Forecast, Analysis and Reanalysis. Forecast models are comprised of physics-based equations and propogate an atmospheric state forward in time, i.e. given the vaules of different parameters at time t, one can calculate the values for time t+dt. Analysis basically does the same thing, however instead of the prediction by physics, it takes place by statistical methods. In other words, given the observations at some locations, one can come up with an estimation for different parameters at locations that there is no observation available. There are different physics-based models and also different assumptions and methodologies in data assimilation, which experience modifications along the time. Besides, instrumnetation also changes as time passes and technology improves. Reanalysis takes all these variations into account and yield a comprehensive and coherent dataset over the globe. It is supposedly the best dataset for looking into the past weather. More infomation can be found [here](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds083.2/docs/Analysis.pdf).
  
## Problem / Question
For this study, among different publicly available models, two will be considered. The main objective of the work is to compare their dataset for some primary climatological variables (precipitation, temperature, wind, snow), within both temporal and spatial scopes.
One of the models is called High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) which is a forecast model (with forecast length of 18 hours) generating data to a 3-km resolution grid, hourly. More information about HRRR can be find [here](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/hrrr_FAQ.html). The other model to use is ERA5 which is a climate reanlysis dataset of up to 3 month before  with 30-km resolution at an hourly frequency. More information about ERA5 dataset can be found [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5). Summry of the models are provided in the following table.

|Model|Type|Resolution|Frequency|
|-----|----|----------|---------|
|**HRRR**|forecast|3 km|hourly|
|**ERA5**|reanlaysis|30 km|hourly|

The main reason for choosing these two models is that one of them has a significantly higher resolution and, on the other hand, the other is supposedly based on a more powerful model.

## Inspiring Examples

Following gif and image are provided to demonstrate the idea of this project and the way that authors will communicate with audience, which is basically making a comparison between different models.

## Proposed data sources

Each model has its own archive and support, accessible by public. HRRR data can be found following [this instruction](http://home.chpc.utah.edu/~u0553130/Brian_Blaylock/cgi-bin/hrrr_download.cgi), and ERA5 can be downloaded following [this instruction](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5).
Also, observations from weather stations can be found from [NOAA LCD Tool](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd).

## Proposed methods

The output of HRRR and ERA5 are summarized in GRIB2 and NetCDF formats, respectively. Considering the State of New York as the case study, the output of both models are loaded in the working directory for two years. They are meteorological datasets, including precipitation, temperature, wind, and snow, which are mapped at specific grid cells. Using the raster package, the output dataset of both models can be read. Dealing with the spatial dataset, in addition to raster package, sf and sp packages are also useful to manage the data. In order to compare two models, first, the output dataset of each model needs to be mapped over the same grid cells. As a result, two raster objects will be produced to project values of meteorological parameters on the same grid cells. In the next step, the hourly dataset will be aggregated to produce data at daily and monthly resolution, and statistical characteristics of them are calculated and plotted applying ggplot2. In this study, the output of both models will be visualized for each meteorological parameter over two years as a gif using gganimate package to provide a general understanding of the models' outputs. Furthermore, the difference between both datasets will be investigated by mapping the difference over the case study and visualizing the result as new plots. In addition, the temporal difference behavior between these two models will be studied by plotting both dataset as time series over two years.

## Expected results

The primary result would be to assess the order of difference between the two models, and this will be demonstrated by maps like the ones provided as example and also time series of variables.
Not having processed the data yet, it is expected that ERA5 performs better. This hypothesis can be examined by verifying the performance of the both models using the observational data from weather stations, if time allows to.
